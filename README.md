# rpiCap
Ok, this is the big one.  My project to create an Open Source MoCap Camera based on an RPi 3.

## Requirements
 - Several Raspberry Pi SbCs with following capabilities:
    - Camera Interface
    - Ethernet
    - Working PtP implementation (!)
 - A 1GB Switch with sufficent ports for all cameras, a sync board, and a connection to the host PC _Advanced Configurations are discussed in the Project Wiki_
 - A Calibration Wand _See Wiki_
 - A MoCap Suit and Markers

## Setting up
**TBD**

## Licence
This project is subject to the GPLv3 Licence, a copy is in the root, and will be refferenced in the source and resource files going forwards.

## Future
The logical conclusion is an Open Source MoCap system - See Gimli: https://github.com/bit-meddler/Gimli
